## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### Dummy Payment System Architecture

#### Backend Implementation
```javascript
// Dummy Payment Controller
class DummyPaymentController {
  // Validate payment details
  validatePayment(paymentData) {
    // Luhn algorithm for card validation
    // Expiry date validation
    // CVV validation
  }
  
  // Process dummy payment
  processPayment(paymentData, orderId) {
    // Simulate payment processing
    // Return success/failure based on card number
    // Update order status
  }
}
```

#### Frontend Implementation
```javascript
// Dummy Payment Form Component
const DummyPaymentForm = () => {
  // Credit card input fields
  // Real-time validation
  // Payment simulation
  // Success/failure handling
}
```

```javascript
// Payment Model
const PaymentSchema = {
  orderId: ObjectId,
  amount: Number,
  currency: String,
  paymentMethod: String,
  status: String, // 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'
  transactionId: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
```
